**HIGHLIGHTS:**
1. The CNN-based selective fixed-filter active noise control (SFANC) method is implemented in a multichannel ANC window, which can achieve delayless noise reduction through the efficient coordination between the co-processor and real-time controller.

2. Combining practical experience, this paper abstracts ANC as a Markov progress and provides a detailed theoretical analysis to verify the reasonableness of the CNN-based SFANC method.

3. An explainable AI technique, LayerCAM, is used to provide visual explanations of the decision-making process in the CNN-based SFANC method.

4. Simulations and real-time experiments show that the CNN-based SFANC method not only effectively attenuates different types of low-frequency noise but also exhibits good transferability.
