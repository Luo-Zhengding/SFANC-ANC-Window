**HIGHLIGHTS:**
1. CNN-based selective fixed-filter active noise control (SFANC) algorithm is implemented in a window for real-time noise control, marking the first practical implementation of this technique.
2. The real SFANC system can achieve delayless noise reduction through the efficient coordination between the co-processor and real-time controller.
3. The explainable AI technique via class activation map (CAM) is used to visually analyze the effectiveness of the CNN model in SFANC.
4. Real-time experiments show that the CNN-based SFANC not only effectively reduces different types of noise but also exhibits good transferability.
